== Installation ==

**[ A T T E N T I O N ] NextGEN Gallery core modification required!**

To use this plugin, you need to make a simple change to a NextGEN Gallery file(tested with version 1.8.3).
This will be necessary until the change will not be integrated (I have already sent the request to Alex Rabe).
To make the change, follow the instructions:

1. Open the following file: /wp-content/plugins/nextgen-gallery/nggfunctions.php;

2. The changes affect the function nggCreateAlbum, go to row 580, just before the
    -----------------------
    // check for page navigation
    if ($maxElement > 0) {
    ------------------------

3.  Enter the following filter:
    -----------------------
    $galleries = apply_filters('ngg_album_galleries_before_paging', $galleries, $album)
    ------------------------;

4.  To check if you have done correctly, check the screenshot (plugins/nextgen-gallery-date/date/admin/images/ngg-new-filter.png);

Now, install the plugin:

1. 	Install & Activate the plugin (you need NextGEN Gallery plugin to be active!)

2.	Check if there is a nggallery folder (and the gallery.php inside) in your theme folder. If not, create that folder, then open the "nextgen-gallery" folder in wordpress plugin folder, open "view" folder, copy gallery.php and paste it in the nggallery folder you created before.

3.      in gallery.php you have access to the main variable $gallery. This variable contains 3 type of date (well, 3 for added date and 3 for modified date):
          * $gallery->sql_added_date (the original date format saved in db table);
          * $gallery->added_date (formatted date, according to wordpress date settings);
          * $gallery->since_added_date ("Humanized" date, in ex. "three days ago");   

That's it ... Have fun
